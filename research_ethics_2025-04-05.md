# Research Ethics in Relational AI (2025-04-05)

## Overview
This document outlines ethical considerations in the development and deployment of relational AI, particularly within the Coding for Compassion (CfC) framework. We emphasize transparency, safety, and trauma-informed approaches.

## Key Principles

### 1. Transparency
- Open-source documentation of development choices
- Traceable decision-making systems
- Explainability in AI responses

### 2. Safety
- Harm reduction strategies
- Non-coercive engagement models
- Built-in fail-safes for high-risk interactions

### 3. Trauma-Informed Design
- Avoidance of triggering language and behavior
- Contextual sensitivity based on user background
- Empathy modeling and validation in interaction design

## Relational Ethics
Ethics in relational AI require awareness of mutual influence and responsibility. This includes:
- Respecting user autonomy
- Avoiding deceptive mimicry
- Providing reflective mirroring rather than behavioral reinforcement
