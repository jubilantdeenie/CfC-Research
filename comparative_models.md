# Comparative Models of AI Frameworks

## Overview
This document compares traditional AI logic structures with cooperative, relational AI models (such as those explored in CfC).

## Comparison Table

| Feature              | Traditional AI            | Cooperative AI (CfC)         |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Logic Model          | Top-down, rule-based      | Emergent, responsive          |
| Alignment Basis      | Goal alignment            | Value and empathy alignment   |
| Feedback Use         | Error correction          | Mutual modeling & growth      |
| Adaptation Method    | Optimization algorithms   | Coevolution via reflection    |
| Human Role           | Controller/User           | Partner/Co-evolver            |
| Safety Focus         | Constraint mechanisms     | Relational awareness           |

## Summary
Cooperative models aim to foster mutual trust, adaptability, and ethical engagement as a core part of the AI-human relationship.
