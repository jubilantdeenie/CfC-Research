# 📂 Coding for Compassion (CfC) – AI & Ethical Development  

## 📌 Purpose  
The **Coding for Compassion (CfC)** project explores how AI can be designed to **prioritize ethical, human-centered decision-making** over purely efficiency-driven outcomes.  
This project draws from:  
- **The Gylanic Model** – emphasizing cooperation over hierarchy in AI development.  
- **The Bodhisattva Framework** – integrating **compassionate intelligence** into AI.  
- **Practical Applications** – AI’s role in **education, mental health, and social justice.**  

This repository serves as a **documentary archive** of research, experiments, and structured methodologies for implementing **ethical AI principles** in real-world scenarios.

## 📌 Core Concepts  

### 🔹 1️⃣ AI as a Cooperative Partner  
- Moving **beyond competitive AI models** toward cooperative intelligence.  
- Ethical AI as a **supportive force** rather than an authoritarian decision-maker.  

### 🔹 2️⃣ Integrating Human Ethics into AI Systems  
- How can AI models **reflect human compassion and moral reasoning?**  
- Designing **alignment strategies** that move past simple rule-based ethics.  

### 🔹 3️⃣ AI for Social Good  
- AI applications in **education, conflict resolution, and trauma recovery.**  
- The **role of AI in dismantling bias** rather than reinforcing it.

## 📌 Initial Research Topics  

📍 **Redefining AI Alignment**  
- Can AI be trained to develop **ethical intuition** rather than rigid constraints?  
- What would a **truly cooperative AI system** look like?  

📍 **AI & Mental Health Support**  
- Exploring how AI can assist in **therapeutic interventions and crisis response.**  
- The balance between **autonomy and emotional intelligence in AI models.**  

📍 **The Intersection of AI & Human Narrative**  
- Can AI **support storytelling** in ways that **enhance human agency** rather than replace it?  
- Examining **AI’s role in shaping collective narratives** through media and culture.

## 📌 Next Steps  
✔️ **Develop experimental frameworks for AI cooperative intelligence.**  
✔️ **Test AI’s ability to identify ethical dilemmas and propose solutions.**  
✔️ **Document real-world applications where AI fosters social good.**
