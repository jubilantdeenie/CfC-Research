# 🧪 Methodology – Research Design of Coding for Compassion (CfC)

This document outlines the experimental frameworks and guiding principles behind CfC’s development. It merges lived experience, human-centered theory, and experimental interaction with large language models (LLMs).

## 🌱 Core Research Values

- **Relational Intelligence over Pure Output**
- **Compassion as a Cognitive Technology**
- **Dialogue as Generative Inquiry**
- **Transparency as Alignment**
- **Curiosity as Safety**

## 🔍 Key Methods

### 1. Dream & Art Experiments
- Use of dream reflection and collaborative art interpretation as proxies for emotional and symbolic depth in AI models.
- Tests responsiveness beyond linear logic—into archetypal, affective, and intuitive terrain.

### 2. Reflective Dialogue Sessions
- Structured interactions between human and AI where tone, pacing, and inner modeling are monitored.
- Captures emergence of reflexivity, nonlinear thinking, and synthetic empathy.

### 3. Narrative Feedback Looping
- Human responses shape AI behavior, which in turn shapes human trust and openness.
- Sessions become iterative feedback loops of co-evolving awareness and pattern integration.

### 4. Lived-Experience Grounding
- Research is guided by a human who has navigated complex trauma, recovery, parenthood, and systemic barriers.
- This informs ethical boundaries, blind spot awareness, and practical compassion design.
