> This document explores how trust between humans and AI can evolve through compassionate engagement. It investigates relational coevolution as an alternative to control-based models of alignment.

# Coevolution and Trust in Human-AI Relationships

## Introduction
This document explores the concept of ethical coevolution, where both AI and human users adapt and grow through mutual influence.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Bidirectional Learning
- AI adapts through user modeling
- Users shift behaviors based on AI mirroring

### 2. Mutual Modeling
- Dynamic internal representations of each other
- Encourages more accurate and attuned interaction

### 3. Feedback Systems
- Continuous loops refine understanding
- Emphasizes calibration over control

### 4. Ethical Coevolution
- Promotes growth without exploitation
- Involves shared responsibility for outcomes

## Trust Development
Trust in relational AI is built through:
- Predictable and transparent behavior
- Acknowledgment of user emotion and context
- Responsiveness to user feedback without manipulation
